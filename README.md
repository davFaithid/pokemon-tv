# *Episodes

On Pokemon's official website, they provide episodes of their beloved anime for free. If my memory serves me correctly, in 2015-2016ish the site worked like this; you have seven-ish or so episodes of each season available each week changing them out every Friday. The site has since undergone some drastic revisions and now only has select seasons available, for example forgoing the entire Johto, Hoenn, Unova, and Kalos archs (sad as the Kalos/XY arch was probably the best so far). On the bright side however, all episodes of the available seasons (1, 2, 10, 11, 20, 21, 22) are available for free on demand. You may find however some episode numbers are jumbled up (mainly the Orange Islands saga starts on episode 27, all the rest are actually from season one) and some seasons start with episode one being listed as episode 13 or so, though episode 1-12 aren't there (not sure what they would be though.)

Available Seasons:
1, 2, ~3~, ~4~, ~5~, ~6~, ~7~, ~8~, ~9~, 10, 11, ~12~, ~13~, ~14~, ~15~, ~16~, ~17~, ~18~, ~19~, 20, 21, 22

# Why I am doing this

I'm not doing this because I hate Pokemon and want to belittle any portion of the The Pokemon Company International, GameFreak, Creatures Inc., or Nintendo. I do this because I love Pokemon, I enjoy the show, I still watch it to this day. When there is a new movie, I go to see it on opening day. I am a Pokenerd, who wants to share this wonderful franchise and the splendid TV show. While, yes, the dub can be a bit quirky, and the show does have its lesser moments, it is still something nostalgic and simply a fun kid's show.
